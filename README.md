<img src="assets/area.png" width="60%"/>

Similar to a line chart, except that the area below the lines is filled with colors to represent and compare the evolution of quantitative values over a time period. Values of each category are displayed on top of each other, allowing to understand the evolution of both the total of a numeric variable, and the importance of each category.
